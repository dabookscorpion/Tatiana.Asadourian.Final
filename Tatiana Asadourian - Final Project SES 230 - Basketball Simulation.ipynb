    "Note: This program has been completed, but still has a lot of bugs and does not run through properly without raising errors. I cannot figure out how to solve them and don't want to lose more percentage points than I already have by submitting this late. So, I am turning it in as is. My write-up will explain my original plan, the intentions behind everything I included, my explanation/prediction on why the bugs exist/what's preventing the program from running smoothly, and what I expected the output to be.
