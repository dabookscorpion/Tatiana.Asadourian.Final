    "This program will simulate a game of basketball between two NBA teams, in which the abilities of each player is input according to their statistics so far in the NBA 2023-2024 Season.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be simulating a game between the Boston Celtics (my dad's, and therefore my, favorite team), and the Los Angeles Lakers, their all-time rivals. However, this code can be altered to simulate other teams by inputting the stats of other teams' players.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistics will include field goal percentage (FG%), three-pointer percentage (3P%), probability of attempting two-pointer vs. three-pointer (2v3%), personal fouls per 100 possessions (PF%), offensive rebounds per 100 possessions (OREB%), and defensive rebounds per 100 possessions (DREB%). \n",
    "\n",
    "Tip-off will be decided by 50/50 chance--there is no amount of data that can predict which player will jump higher in the moment to tip off the ball--which is exactly why this event decides the team that has possession at the beginning of the first and fourth quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in the NBA, the maximum amount of fouls any of my players can rack up is 6 fouls before they are fouled out and excluded from the game. This happens rarely, but it will still be possible with the PF% statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this simulation, violations (breaking basic rules of the game--different from fouls) will be a randomized factor. I chose to do this because in the NBA, breaking basic game rules does not happen nearly as often as in lower-level leagues because professional players are accustomed to the basic rules of the game. Breaking basic game rules like traveling or throwing the ball out of bounds are not intentional, but can happen to anyone. Per this logic, violations will be up to random.random probability---the penalty for any violation is a turnover. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will not be considering the importance of the 5 different positions in basketball for the sake of this simulation. While certain players will retain their likelihood of succeeding in certain aspects of the game, I will not be inputting each player's typical position or evaluate their height/weight/agility in order to determine their position for the game. This is just for simplicity's sake, as the statistics speak for themselves for most of the game's logistic/probability-related issues. I am not an NBA coach strategizing which players to put into the game--I will facilitate player switches based on fouls\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, I cannot simulate the game in real time as far as our class has taught us. So, instead, I will run each quarter according to the average amount of possessions each team typically obtains each quarter, and use that as the limit to how long the quarter lasts. This will also account for many of the time-stopping aspects of the game like fouls and turnovers, which will be simulated in my program, so this alteration should still be relatively accurate to real games.\n",
    "\n",
    "One extra question I will investigate is how often a half-court shot pays off. In real life, it's known that half-court shots are only attempted 25% of the time in the first, second, and third quarter, and less than 10% of the time in the fourth quarter. When investigated further, it is clear that these half-court shots are almost entirely only ever made in the fourth quarter when there is a 2 to 3 point difference between the teams where a half-court buzzer beater might actually change the outcome of the game--otherwise, it's not worth shooting. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, I will investigate not only how often the half-court shot succeeds (according to Wikipedia, the chance of making a half court shot is 1 in 100 attempts, so I will use this statistic) but in particular, I want to investigate how often this actually changes the outcome of a game that is very close in points at the end. In my program, I will run an attempt at initiating a half-court shot in the first, second, and third quarter with a 25% probability of a player attempting it and a 1% chance of making the shot. In the fourth quarter, I will only run the attempt if the points, after being assessed, only have a 1 to 3 point difference, warranting the urgency for a half-court shot in the last possession of the game."
